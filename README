The Python script in this project can be used to access Twitter influence metrics from the Infochimps
data market described in the PayPal X.com DevZone "Selling Digital Goods in Data Markets" article series.

For more information, please refer to the articles.  The first installment, introducing data markets and
some of the major innovators, is available at:

The second article discussing how to find an appropriate dataset and access data in it, especially 
focusing upon Infochimps' Twitter influence metrics API and accessing it using YQL, is at:
https://bit.ly/esITZ5

See also http://bit.ly/hxarz2 and http://bit.ly/gVAQGe for more on the influence metrics and YQL.

I will update this README to link to the remaining articles as they are published.
