The Python script in this project can be used to access Twitter influence metrics from the Infochimps
data market described in the PayPal X.com DevZone "Selling Digital Goods in Data Markets" article series.

This four part article series introduces data markets and their features, shows you how to select a
market and begin extracting data from it, explores how premium dataset purchases work in commercial
markets, and then discusses the steps required to build a commercial data market with micropayments
for subsections of a given dataset and a general-purpose data market REST API.  Examples included
in the articles use REST+JSON, Python, YQL, and Google App Engine.
