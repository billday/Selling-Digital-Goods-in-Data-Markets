The Python scripts in this project can be used to access and manipulate data from data markets described
in the PayPal X.com DevZone "Selling Digital Goods in Data Markets" article series.

For more information, please refer to the articles.  The first installment, introducing data markets and
some of the major innovators, is available at:

The next installment discussing how to find an appropriate dataset and access data in it, especially 
focusing upon Infochimps Twitter influence metrics API access and YQL, will publish soon.  I will update
this README to link to it once it is available.
